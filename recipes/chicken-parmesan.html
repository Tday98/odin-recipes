    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pound chicken to an even thickness: Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Don't skimp on seasoning: Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs: Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.</li>
        <li>Rest before cooking: Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast.</li>
    </ol>
